<h1 id="1.intro">Project Introduction - Weather Station </h1>

This Project is to give an educational foundation to java mainly, spring boot framework and front-end design with a flair of AI. 

<b>Why weather?</b><br>
Weather is a common issue in our location, changes regular, but what about clothes this can be difficult with the change of weather and the style or practical design we wish to use for our day-to-day travels. Comfort is the main mission for us and the proudness of how we look in our day to day.  

This project will tackle this question from a standpoint of how to use AI to learn from weather on a day to day and run a suggestion with the list of clothes we have in our wardrobe as is how the fridge now knows what is the contents of what we consumer.  

<b>What is the aim?</b><br>
The aim of this project is to try to see, can we help answer this question of organizing our lives more around weather?

<h2 id="2.1.SpringBoot">2.1.SpringBoot</h2>

Generate the following - https://start.spring.io/

Once you have the following updated  <br>
Generate and download to personal computer <br>
Our new file is downloaded and unzipped. To now create a file, we will be working on.  <br>

<img src="images/chapter2_file.png">

New file you can name but ours is different -> <br>

<img src="images/chapter2_image3.png">
Open up IntelliJ and here we can open the project  <br>

Once we located and selected the folder with all the following spring boot project, we then load this to our IntelliJ. <br>
<img src="images/chapter2_intelij.png">

This is now completed.  <br>
Second step is to upload to our git hub so that all changes done we can record and try.  <br>

<h2 id="2.2.git">2.2.How to start our git creation</h2>
Using copilot -> <b>Link - https://chatgpt.com/g/g-2DQzU5UZl-code-copilot/c/e4cdf976-8fe0-467f-a27c-615b0fa5d688</b>

First thing is first to test that git is installed on our machine we need to first check by opening cmd if on windows. <br>

The command -> C:\Users\Eoin\Desktop\WeatherApp>git version <br>
The expected response -> git version 2.43.0. windows.1 <br>

<img src="images/chapter3_terminal1.png">

We will need to run this on PowerShell as the commands we used did not recognise. Moving this PowerShell, we will need to again locate the directory.<br>

Using basic windows terminal commands of cd and then the file path.  <br>
- PS C:\Users\Eoin\Desktop\WeatherApp> gh repo create WeatherStation --private --source=.
- PS C:\Users\Eoin\Desktop\WeatherApp> cd Weather
- PS C:\Users\Eoin\Desktop\WeatherApp\Weather> git init
- PS C:\Users\Eoin\Desktop\WeatherApp\Weather> git status
- PS C:\Users\Eoin\Desktop\WeatherApp\Weather> gh repo create WeatherStation
- PS C:\Users\Eoin\Desktop\WeatherApp\Weather> echo "# Weather Station" >> README.md
- PS C:\Users\Eoin\Desktop\WeatherApp\Weather> git add README.md
- PS C:\Users\Eoin\Desktop\WeatherApp\Weather> git commit -m "Initial commit
 <br>
Now our new repository is now up and running but not the main code
<br><img src="images/chapter3_githubRe.png"> <br>

- git config --global user.name "Your Name"
- git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
- Create a new directory
- mkdir my-new-repo
- cd my-new-repo
- git init
<br>
Now GIT was created but not our project was added to this repository.  <br>
The errors seen after the repository was created <br>
<br><img src="images/chapter3_GitHub_Comamnds1.png"> <br>

So, we had to reinitialize the repository and push. 
<br><img src="images/chapter3_GitHub_Comamnds2.png"> <br>

Now we checked our git hub site to see if this worked.  yes, as you can see but this is on a different branch called Main.  <br>
<br><img src="images/chapter3_github_Repo_Comp.png"> <br>

Our project is here and ready to work. We now must start creating our api project and test that the values we want works.  <br>
Our next step is to now work on java and the springboot framework.  <br>

<h1 id="ProjectDesign">4.Planning our Project Design.</h1> <br>
In this section we will look at how to design our project and the many steps to achieve this part of the project of getting our api to work and to display the info.<br> 
<img src="images/chapter4_plan.png">

<h2 id="4.1APiTemplate">4.1.Choosing our Api template</h2> <br>

In this section we need to decide on the weather api we want to use. There are many signup options and what each one provided in their responses.  <br>

The api we have a choice of are two we had picked. During this process moved to the second one as the response and using is the easiest.  <br>

Link 1 =  https://openweathermap.org/api <br>
Link 2 = https://www.weatherapi.com/api-explorer.aspx <br>

<h3 id="4.1.1.APiTemplate_1">4.1.1.Open Weather API</h3> <br>
Api 1 - https://www.weatherapi.com/api-explorer.aspx
<br>
<img src="images/chapter4_api requirements example 2.png">
<br>
We tested with this model as suggested by many examples used but also investigeted using the other for testing purposes. 
<br>
In post man we copied the main link and here added search fields with the tag to host our token to access the data and show in our test examples. 
<br>

<br>

<h3 id="4.1.2.APiTemplate_2">4.1.2.weather api</h3> <br>
Api 2 - 

Once we signed up on free trial, we can create our api token to use when making calls.

Let's navigate to our java src and start creating our structure of what we need and why. Our first step is to make sure our project works and builds
