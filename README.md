<b>Why weather?</b><br>
Weather is a common issue in our location, changes regular, but what about clothes this can be difficult with the change of weather and the style or practical design we wish to use for our day-to-day travels. Comfort is the main mission for us and the proudness of how we look in our day to day.  

This project will tackle this question from a standpoint of how to use AI to learn from weather on a day to day and run a suggestion with the list of clothes we have in our wardrobe as is how the fridge now knows what is the contents of what we consumer.  

<b>What is the aim?</b><br>
The aim of this project is to try to see can we help answer this question of organizing our lives more around weather.
